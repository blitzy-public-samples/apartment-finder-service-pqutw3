# HUMAN ASSISTANCE NEEDED
# The following aspects may need human verification or customization:
# - Ensure that environment variables (GCP_KEY_FILE, GCP_PROJECT_ID, VERSION) are properly set
# - Verify that the Docker image name and tag are correct
# - Confirm that the Kubernetes deployment name (app-deployment) is accurate
# - Check if there are multiple Cloud Functions to be updated
# - Add any additional deployment steps specific to your application
