### BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

1. **API Integration Complexity**: The cost and effort required for Zillow API integration may vary based on API complexity and potential changes. We've allocated additional hours in the backend development budget to account for this uncertainty.

2. **Scalability Requirements**: As user base grows, infrastructure costs may increase. We've included a scalable cloud solution in the budget, but actual costs may vary based on usage.

3. **Data Volume**: The amount of data processed from Zillow may affect storage and processing costs. We've estimated based on initial projections, but this should be monitored closely.

4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Changes in data protection laws may require additional legal consultation or system modifications. The contingency fund can partially cover this if needed.

5. **Third-party Service Costs**: Zillow API or PayPal integration costs may change. We've budgeted based on current pricing, but this should be reviewed regularly.

6. **Market Expansion**: Costs for expanding to additional markets beyond the greater Boston area are not included in this budget and would require separate estimation.

7. **User Acquisition Costs**: Marketing costs may vary based on the effectiveness of initial campaigns. The budget includes an initial marketing push, but additional funds may be needed for sustained growth.

8. **Exchange Rate Fluctuations**: If any services or tools are priced in non-USD currencies, exchange rate changes could impact the budget.

    "Software" : 15500
    "Legal" : 7500
    "Marketing" : 20000
    "Contingency" : 26100
```

To manage these budget considerations:

1. Implement a robust monitoring system for resource usage and costs.
2. Conduct regular budget reviews and adjust allocations as needed.
3. Maintain open communication with the client about potential budget impacts.
4. Use agile development methodologies to adapt quickly to changing requirements or constraints.
5. Prioritize features to ensure core functionality is delivered within budget.

This budget provides a comprehensive overview of expected costs and potential variables. Regular review and adjustment will be crucial to ensure project success within financial constraints.
